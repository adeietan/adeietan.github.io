I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland, working with [Dr. Nathan Fox](https://nacs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/fox/nathan). My research explores the building blocks of early socioemotional processes and the long-term implications of early individual differences. I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology at the University of British Columbia in 2021, working with [Dr. Kiley Hamlin](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kiley-hamlin/). My doctoral studies examined the mechanisms underlying young children's responses to prosocial and antisocial scenarios. At the University of Maryland, my current research explores the nature of social anxiety and the long-term consequences of early adversity.
