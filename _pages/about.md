I'm a developmental psychologist studying early cognitive and social processes, with a particular interest in the mind-body problem within social contexts - examining how social cognitive processes relate to physical states of the body/brain. I received my PhD from the University of British Columbia in 2021, focusing on the neurophysiological processes underlying infantsâ€™ responses to social interactions (e.g., helping/hindering). Recently, I completed a postdoctoral program at the University of Maryland, investigating the developmental roots of social anxiety and the links between early brain activity and cognitive functioning. My research utilizes various methods including eye-tracking, pupillometry, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrodermal activity (EDA).

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with family, hiking, biking, listening to music, and dancing Lindy Hop.
