I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland, working with [Dr. Nathan Fox](https://nacs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/fox/nathan). My research examines psychological processes early in life and their long-term implications. I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology at the University of British Columbia in 2021. My doctoral research with [Dr. Kiley Hamlin](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kiley-hamlin/) examined the neurocognitive mechanisms of sociomoral evaluations in infants and toddlers. At the University of Maryland, my research explores the developmental origins of anxiety problems and the long-term consequences of early psychosocial deprivation. I pursue these questions using an array of methods, including behavioral paradigms, eye-tracking, electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrodermal activity (EDA).
