I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland, working with [Dr. Nathan Fox](https://nacs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/fox/nathan). My research explores the building blocks of early social cognition and the long-term implications of early individual differences. I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology at the University of British Columbia in 2021. My doctoral studies with [Dr. Kiley Hamlin](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kiley-hamlin/) examined the mechanisms underlying young children's responses to prosocial and antisocial scenarios. At the University of Maryland, my research explores the origins of anxiety and the long-term consequences of early adversity.
