I'm a psychologist studying early cognitive and social processes, with a particular interest in the mind-body problem within social contexts - examining how social cognition interfaces with the physical states of the brain and body. I completed my PhD from the University of British Columbia in 2021, focusing on the neurophysiological processes underlying infantsâ€™ responses to social interactions. Following this, I completed a postdoctoral program at the University of Maryland, investigating the links between early brain activity and cognitive functioning and the developmental roots of social anxiety. Currently, as a postdoc at the University of British Columbia, I'm using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and machine learning to investigate how social information and speech are represented in the brains of adults and infants.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with family, hiking, biking, listening to music, and dancing Lindy Hop.
