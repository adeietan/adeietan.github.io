I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland, working with [Dr. Nathan Fox](https://nacs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/fox/nathan). My research examines early psychological processes and their long-term implications. I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology at the University of British Columbia in 2021. My doctoral studies with [Dr. Kiley Hamlin](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kiley-hamlin/) examined the nature and mechanisms of early sociomoral evaluations using neurophysiological measures. At the University of Maryland, my research explores the origins of anxiety problems and the long-term consequences of early psychosocial deprivation.
