I received my PhD in Developmental Psychology from the University of British Columbia in 2021. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Child Development Lab at the University of Maryland. My research explores the building blocks of early social cognition and affective processes. My PhD dissertation examined the mechanisms underlying young children's responses to prosocial and antisocial events. At the Child Development Lab, my research explores the nature of social anxiety and the long-term consequences of early adversity.
