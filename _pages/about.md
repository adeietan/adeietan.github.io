I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland, working with [Dr. Nathan Fox](https://nacs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/fox/nathan). My research examines early psychological processes and contextual factors that shape our social nature. I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology at the University of British Columbia in 2021. My doctoral research with [Dr. Kiley Hamlin](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/kiley-hamlin/) addresses fundamental debates about the nature of sociomoral responses during the first years of life. At the University of Maryland, my research explores the developmental origins of social anxiety and the long-term consequences of early psychosocial deprivation. I pursue these questions using a variety of methods, including eye-tracking, electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrodermal activity (EDA).
