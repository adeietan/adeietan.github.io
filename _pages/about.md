I'm a developmental psychologist studying early cognitive and social processes, with a particular interest in the mind-body problem within social contexts-examining how social cognitive processes relate to physical states of the body and brain. I received my PhD from the University of British Columbia in 2021, focusing on the neurophysiological processes underlying infants’ and young children’s responses to social interactions (e.g., helping/hindering). Recently, I completed a postdoctoral program at the University of Maryland, investigating the developmental roots of social anxiety and the connections between resting brain activity and cognitive functioning. My research employs various methods including eye-tracking, pupillometry, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrodermal activity (EDA).
